	abstract = {In this paper we demonstrate the application of object detection networks for the classification and localization of cells in fluorescence microscopy. We benchmark two leading object detection algorithms across multiple challenging 2-D microscopy datasets as well as develop and demonstrate an algorithm which can localize and image cells in 3-D, in real-time. Furthermore, we exploit the fast processing of these algorithms and develop a simple and effective Augmented Reality (AR) system for fluorescence microscopy systems. Object detection networks are well-known high performance networks famously applied to the task of identifying and localizing objects in photography images. Here we show their application and efficiency for localizing cells in fluorescence microscopy images. Object detection algorithms are typically trained on many thousands of images, which can be prohibitive within the biological sciences due to the cost of imaging and annotating large amounts of data. Through taking different cell types and assays as an example, we show that with some careful considerations that it is possible to achieve very high performance with datasets with as few as 26 images present. Through using our approach, it is possible for relatively non-skilled users to automate detection of cell classes with a variety of appearances and enable new avenues for automation of conventionally manual fluorescence microscopy acquisition pipelines.},

abstract = {Abstract Analyzing cellular morphologies on a cell-by-cell basis is vital for drug discovery, cell biology, and many other biological studies. Interactions between cells in their culture environments cause cells to touch each other in acquired microscopy images. Because of this phenomenon, cell segmentation is a challenging task, especially when the cells are of similar brightness and of highly variable shapes. The concept of topological dependence and the maximum common boundary (MCB) algorithm are presented in our previous work (Yu et al., Cytometry Part A 2009;75A:289–297). However, the MCB algorithm suffers a few shortcomings, such as low computational efficiency and difficulties in generalizing to higher dimensions. To overcome these limitations, we present the evolving generalized Voronoi diagram (EGVD) algorithm. Utilizing image intensity and geometric information, EGVD preserves topological dependence easily in both 2D and 3D images, such that touching cells can be segmented satisfactorily. A systematic comparison with other methods demonstrates that EGVD is accurate and much more efficient. © 2010 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry},
